    Saturday sunset
    We're lying on my bed with five hours to go
    Fingers entwined and so were our minds
    Cryin', "I don't want you to go"
    You wiped away your tears
    But not fears under the still and clear indigo
    You said, "Baby, don't cry, we'll be fine
    You're the one thing I swear I can't outgrow"
    My mother said the younger me was a pretending prodigy
    Well, nothing then, much has changed
    'Cause while you're wolfin' down liquor
    My soul, it gets sicker
    But I'm stickin' to the screenplay
    Gotta say I'm okay, but answer this, babe
    How is it now that somehow you're a stranger?
    You were mine just yesterday
    I pray the block in my airway dissipates
    And instead deters your airplane's way
    But heaven denied
    Destiny decried
    Something beautiful died
    Too soon
    But I'm letting go
    I'm givin' up the ghost
    But don't get me wrong
    I'll always love you, that's why
    I wrote you this very last song
    I guess this is where we say goodbye
    I know I'll be alright
    Someday I'll be fine
    But just not tonight (ooh)
    Plungin' into all kinds of diversions
    Like blush wine and sonorous soirées
    But even with gin and surgin' adrenaline
    I see you're all that can intoxicate
    Oceans and engines
    You're skilled at infringin' on great love affairs
    'Cause now my heart's home
    All I've known is long gone and ten thousand miles away
    And I'm not okay
    But I'm letting go
    I'm giving up the ghost
    But don't get me wrong
    I'll always love you, that's why
    I wrote you this very last song
    I guess this is where we say goodbye
    I know I'll be alright
    But just not
    Tonight was the first time I stared into seas
    Of beguiling sepia two years ago
    And the first time I learned real world superpowers lived in three words
    They revitalize my fraying bones, oh
    Now what do you do when your pillar crumbled down
    You've lost all solid ground
    Both dreams and demons drowned
    And this void's all you've found
    And doubts light it aglow?
    I have so many questions
    But I'm pouring them into the ocean
    And I'm starting up my engine
    And I'm letting go
    I'm givin' up your ghost
    It's come to a close
    I marked the end with this last song I wrote
    I'm letting go
    This is the last falsetto
    I'll ever sing to you
    My great lost love`},
    { id: 1, lyrics: `
    Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
    You know that I caught it
    Bad, bad boy
    Shiny toy with a price
    You know that I bought it
    Killing me slow, out the window
    I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
    Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
    What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
    And it's new, the shape of your body
    It's blue, the feeling I've got
    And it's ooh, whoa, oh
    It's a cruel summer
    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
    No rules in breakable heaven
    But ooh, whoa oh
    It's a cruel summer
    With you
    Hang your head low
    In the glow of the vending machine
    I'm not dying
    You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
    We're not trying
    So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
    I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
    Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
    And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know
    Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
    It's blue, the feeling I've got
    And it's ooh, whoa, oh
    It's a cruel summer
    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
    No rules in breakable heaven
    But ooh, whoa, oh
    It's a cruel summer
    With you
    I'm drunk in the back of the car
    And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
    Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true
    I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
    And I snuck in through the garden gate
    Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
    And I screamed for whatever it's worth
    "I love you, " ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?
    He looks up grinning like a devil
    It's new, the shape of your body
    It's blue, the feeling I've got
    And it's ooh, whoa, oh
    It's a cruel summer
    It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
    No rules, in breakable heaven
    But ooh, whoa, oh
    It's a cruel summer
    With you
    I'm drunk in the back of the car
    And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
    Said, "I'm fine, " but it wasn't true
    I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
    And I snuck in through the garden gate
    Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
    And I screamed for whatever it's worth

    [Intro]
    Psst, I see dead people
    (Mustard on the beat, ho)
    
    [Verse 1]
    Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
    Deebo any rap nigga, he a free throw
    Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
    Nail a nigga to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
    What's up with these jabroni-ass niggas tryna see Compton?
    The industry can hate me, fuck 'em all and they mama
    How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
    I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
    Beat your ass and hide the Bible if God watchin'
    Sometimes you gotta pop out and show niggas
    Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
    Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some ho in him
    Pole on him, extort shit, bully Death Row on him
    Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
    You better not ever go to cell block one
    To any bitch that talk to him and they in love
    Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
    They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
    And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
    And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
    Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles
    Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, fuck 'em up
    Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
    Why you trollin' like a bitch? Ain't you tired?
    Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor

    [Chorus]
    They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
    They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
    
    [Verse 2]
    You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, nigga?
    I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, nigga
    Did Cole fouI, I don't know why you still pretendin'
    What is the owl? Bird niggas and bird bitches, go
    The audience not dumb
    Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
    Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
    Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for bitch and you Malibu most wanted
    Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
    Since 2009, I had this bitch jumpin'
    You niggas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
    What OVO for? The "Other Vaginal Option"? Pussy
    Nigga better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
    Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star, "Quit hidin'"
    Fuck a caption, want action, no accident
    And I'm hands-on, he fuck around, get polished
    Fucked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
    Then get his face tatted like a bitch apologizin'
    I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
    From Alondra down to Central, nigga better not speak on Serena
    And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
    That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
    I lean on you niggas like another line of Wock'
    Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
    Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
    Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
    How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
    One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
    Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
    Freaky-ass niggas need to stay they ass inside, ayy
    Roll they ass up like a fresh pack of 'za, ayy
    City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
    [Chorus]
    They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
    They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
    
    [Verse 3]
    Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
    Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
    Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
    Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
    The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
    Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
    You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
    Let me break it down for you, this the real nigga challenge
    You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
    Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
    21 gave you false street cred
    Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
    Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
    2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
    You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
    No, you not a colleague, you a fuckin' colonizer
    The family matter and the truth of the matter
    It was God's plan to show y'all the liar
    
    [Bridge]
    Mm
    Mm-mm
    He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
    He a fan, he a fan, he a
    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
    Freaky-ass nigga, he a 69 God
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
    Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
    Let me hear you say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)
    Say, "OV-ho" (OV-ho)
    Then step this way, step that way
    Then step this way, step that way
    [Outro]
    Are you my friend?
    Are we locked in?
    Then step this way, step that way
    Then step this way, step that way`},

    우리 프로젝트 타이틀 명은 "J-Z"
    We gon' run this town, that's crazy (uh)
    짱박아 놨던 네 똘끼를 꺼내, huh
    해방됐어 넌, now hands in the air
    Mmm, we're not going home tonight, alright
    네 계획에 없던 party
    Up and down, 'round and 'round, hit the spot, spot, spot, spot
    엎치락뒤치락 정신을 왜 차려? 왜?
    Up and down, 'round and 'round, everybody, hit the spot
    Up and down, 'round and 'round, everybody, hit the top
    Up and down, 'round and 'round, everybody, make it loud
    Up and down, 'round and 'round, everybody, stop, wait a minute, ow!
    Hey, hey
    Yeah, come vibe with us, ride with us (hey)
    Hey, hey

    SEVENTEEN right here
    시작하자 tuning, 맞춰볼까?
    하나의 음정 기준에 맞춰, play it
    SEVENTEEN의 스케르초, 아무래도 조금 특이해도
    북을 치고 줄을 튕겨, 따다라, 따다라, 따다라다 (ah, yeah)
    상관없지 이게 classic or new thang
    또 새로운 조합은 우리 자랑이니까
    Beat부터 melody까지, mix and match가 특기니까
    미쳐야만 정상이 돼, 세상을 바꾸는 우리니까, ah
    뜨거운 함성 두 배로 (배로), 서로를 바라본 채로 (채로)
    나팔을 울려 세계로, you and I, you and I
    Accelerando, 절정으로 올라가자
    높은 곳에서 울리는 소나타 (maestro의 지휘에 맞춰)
    La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Maestro의 지휘에 맞춰
    Good vibe, 잃지 않고 가 절대
    Good life, 우리는 세계로
    Good vibe, 잃지 않고 가 절대
    Maestro의 (yeah) 지휘에 맞춰
    리듬을 바꿨다
    이렇게 techno와
    조합해, 뭐든지 가능해
    주문해, 만들어 드릴게
    이 작품의 완성을 함께할 때
    비로소 하나 되는 우릴 보네
    복잡한 음정과 리듬에서도
    I'll always be with you
    Accelerando, 절정으로 올라가자
    높은 곳에서 울리는 소나타 (maestro의 지휘에 맞춰)
    La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    La-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la
    Maestro의 지휘에 맞춰
    Good vibe, 잃지 않고 가 절대
    Good life, 우리는 세계로
    Good vibe, 잃지 않고 가 절대
    Maestro의 지휘에 맞춰
    리듬은 따다다라다, brass는 바바바람바
    조화로운 우리 서로를 봐
    더 세게 몰아쳐, 점점 더 crescendo
    마지막 악장에, 템포는 a tempo
    Yeah, yeah, yeah (maestro의 지휘에 맞춰)
    Maestro의 지휘에 맞춰
    Good vibe, 잃지 않고 가 절대 (la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
    Good life, 우리는 세계로 (la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la)
    Good vibe, 잃지 않고 가 절대 (la-la, la-la, la-la-la-la-la)

    Baby, I'ma monster
    Mano, a mano
    I see you in slow-mo
    You know you're in trouble
    Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo
    발버둥 쳐봐
    어차피 손바닥
    위에서 못 나가
    You know that
    눈을 뜬 순간 피어나
    All eyes on me 불을 질러라
    Do or die on my life
    Yeah, you ain't seen nothing yet
    Got them all going
    Sheesh, sheesh
    Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh, yeah
    B-A-B-Y-M-O-N
    Sheesh, sheesh
    Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh, yeah
    Got them all going
    Yo, hold on 쉿
    걍 들이부어라 네 달팽이관에
    이건 네 귀에 줄 축복
    음악에 맞춰 걍 춤춰
    히비리 합 합 boom, boom, pow
    분위기 타올라 너네들 눈 돌아
    띵하니 적잖이 충격일 거야
    Crown this queen
    홈런은 쳤고 내 다음은 위
    어중이떠중이 중간 아님
    날 보고 닫혔던 입들 say
    Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh
    You know what it is, I be running this
    Pull up in a ghost, peek a, peek a boo, hoo
    Vroom, vroom 너네 심장에 박동이 pump, pump, pop
    Pedal to the metal
    Click, clack, click, put 'em up to the sky
    High, high, high, high
    눈을 뜬 순간 피어나
    All eyes on me 불을 질러라
    Do or die on my life
    Yeah, you ain't seen nothing yet
    Got them all going
    Sheesh, sheesh
    Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh, yeah
    B-A-B-Y-M-O-N
    Sheesh, sheesh
    Sheesh, sheesh, sheesh, yeah
    Got them all going
    마음껏 웃어봐
    이젠 내 차례니까
    천천히 불태워 네가 잠든 사이
    Time's up
    올라가 올라가 더
    꼭대기 꼭대기로
    하늘 위 하늘 위로
    Fly away
    온 세상을 뒤집어
    Come on, let's ride
    Baby, I'ma monster
    B-A-B-Y-M-O-N
    Tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend
    B-A-B-Y-M-O-N
    Tell a friend, tell a friend, tell a friend (let's go)
    Jump, jump and let it go
    Watch out, we on a roll
    Rum, pump, pump, pump it up then
    Jump, jump and let it go
    Watch out, we on a roll
    Rum, pump, pump, pump it up then`},
